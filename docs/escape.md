party of 1..n players

each player has three stats: life, stamina and special
there are many possible moves for each player, but all moves consume a negative, zero or positive amount of all three stats, as well as take a given number of turns to complete.
Moves can be interrupted or not
The party as a whole only acts when all pending moves are completed. This includes walking, running and resting.


The beauty of this model means that if you decide to run, moving taking shorter, but consumes stamina.
Two characters might have the same technique for striking an opponent, but one might be out of shape a have shorter stamina. Or the other might be more praciced and use less stamina
Say a hacker must concentrate perform a task that takes 5 turns. In that time, the party can protect that player (can this be a special move? or a stance? Positioning? "sentry"?). While the
hacker is performing that move, he won't issue any further command, but others can (this is a special behavior for battles).


TBD:
- other stats
- levelling up
- impact of a move on other characters
- hunger? thirst?
- food?
- inventory?
