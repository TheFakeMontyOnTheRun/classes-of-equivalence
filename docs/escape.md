Tragedy of the Uncanny
======================

Prologue:
The player is a hybrid man, modified during the war to perform scouting missions, hacking and sabotage.
After being in prison for god knows how long, an escape chance appears!

Seems to be the case of a mistaken identity case, since your rescuers where looking for a certain infamous general. You, however, take the chance gracefully and enjoy this opportunity.

Along the way, you try to assemble a group of escapees to help along the way.

There is a transport coming to pick you up, unaware of the identity mistake - and you fully intend to hijack it for your own good.


Gameplay
========

The gameplay is akin to Shinning the holy ark or Phantasy Star 1, with battles when you cross a room boundary.

With each room, you have total freedom to move around.


- party of 1..n players

- each player has three stats: life, stamina and special

- there are many possible moves for each player, but all moves consume a negative, zero or positive amount of all three stats, as well as take a given number of turns to complete.

- Moves can be interrupted or not

- The party as a whole only acts when all pending moves are completed. This includes walking, running and resting.


The beauty of this model means that if you decide to run, moving taking shorter, but consumes stamina.
Two characters might have the same technique for striking an opponent, but one might be out of shape a have shorter stamina. Or the other might be more praciced and use less stamina
Say a hacker must concentrate perform a task that takes 5 turns. In that time, the party can protect that player (can this be a special move? or a stance? Positioning? "sentry"?). While the
hacker is performing that move, he won't issue any further command, but others can (this is a special behavior for battles).


TBD:
- other stats
- levelling up
- impact of a move on other characters
- hunger? thirst?
- food?
- inventory?
