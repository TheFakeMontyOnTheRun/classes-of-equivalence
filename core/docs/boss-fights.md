Boss Fights:

     Besides the final bosses:

    Cyborg Hunter: A specialized cyborg assassin sent by the cult to hunt down escapees. This boss fight could test the player's ability to manage resources, as the cyborg hunter is equipped with stealth abilities that force the player to use tactics and traps.

    Mind-Controlled Ally: One of the hybrids from the group becomes mind-controlled by the cult, turning against the player. This boss fight is both emotional and strategic, requiring players to free their friend or defeat them if necessary.

    Minotaur Guardian: A monstrous hybrid created by the cult, blending human purity with machine augmentation. This guardian protects an important area of the prison, and the battle could involve both physical combat and solving environmental puzzles to weaken the boss.
