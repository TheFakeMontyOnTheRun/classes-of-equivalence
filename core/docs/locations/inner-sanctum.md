# The inner sanctum

A hidden, dark chamber deep within the prison, where the Cult of the Minotaur
conducts secret, gruesome rituals.

The chamber is filled with eerie symbols, flickering candles, and strange
artifacts. The architecture is Gothic, with stone arches and dark, reflective
pools.

The parts selected to eventually constitute the minotaur are kept in golden
pods, guarded with deadly traps.

Very strong guards keep a watch around the sanctum, but are not allowed inside,
being considered _inpure_
