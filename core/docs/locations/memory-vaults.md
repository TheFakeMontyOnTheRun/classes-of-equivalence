# The memory vaults

A place for storing, sorting and analying the collected intel from the _consulted_ prisioners.

It consists of large storage units, resembling pillars with memory cels and a single interface.
On the ceiling, there is a network of cables going from the memory units, converging on a central node.

This area is filled with terminals and abandoned machinery, and the walls are lined with databanks
containing the memories.
