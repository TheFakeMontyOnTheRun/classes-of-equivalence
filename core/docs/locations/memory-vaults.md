# The memory vaults

A place for storing, sorting and analyzing the collected intel from the
_consulted_ prisoners.

It consists of large storage units, resembling pillars with memory cells and a
single interface. On the ceiling, there is a network of cables going from the
memory units, converging on a central node.

This area is filled with terminals and abandoned machinery, and the walls are
lined with data banks containing the memories.
